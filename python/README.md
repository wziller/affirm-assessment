# Python Specific Instructions 

## Setting up your Development Environment
**Install your virtual environment**. Please note this requires Python3.7+

```bash=
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ . . venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) $ python setup.py develop -N
```


**Ensure your tests run**. You must be in the server directory for this.

```python
(.venv) $ nosetests --nologcapture loan_application/tests/
.........
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 9 tests in 0.014s

OK
```


**Run the Server and access the Open API v3.0 Portal**
```python
(.venv) $ python loan_application/app/
```


Then, navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8001/ui/. You should now be able to make JSON requests to the API through the Open API v3.0 UI

You should be able to hit all 6 endpoints (receiving 200 or 400 responses) in the following order. Note that these API endpoints already have pre-populated data you can try out. Any information input will NOT be sent to Affirm, this data is purely for local testing purposes.

| Function      | Endpoint (POST) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Initialize Loan Application      | /api​/v1​/loanapplication​/ |
| Submit Identity   | /api/v1/loanapplication/{loan_application_id}/identity |
| Submit SSN (if needed)  | /api/v1/loanapplication/{loan_application_id}/ssn |
| Submit Income (if needed)  | /api/v1/loanapplication/{loan_application_id}/income |
| Submit Confirmation (if approved)  | /api/v1/loanapplication/{loan_application_id}/confirmation |
| Submit Exit (if denied)  | /api/v1/loanapplication/{loan_application_id}/exit |

**Code Navigation: this is the codebase structure**

## Creating Merchant Config
